      <h3>Archaeological Park-Neolithic Shared Settlement</h3>

      <p>
        Tuzla is a city that links its name and its past to the salt, the natural wealth that remained below Tuzla
        after the Pannonian Sea withdrew to the Black Sea 10 million years ago, in the form of salt water and stone
        salt. The cost and cultural tradition of the city of Tuzla goes far in past, until the Neolithic - the young
        Stone Age, and perhaps still.

        Within the Pannonian Complex, there is an Archaeological Park-Neolithic Shared Settlement. Neolithic settlement
        is a reconstruction of the way of life that existed in this region more than 7,000 years ago, based on
        discovered objects from the Neolithic period, and whose time of origin was confirmed by the Archaeological
        Institute in Vienna using the C4 method. This, unique space has a multifaceted meaning, not only for the
        tourist offer of Tuzla and the region, but also in terms of valorization of the cultural and historical
        heritage.

        intended for activities of young people, their creative initiatives and ideas, as well as several catering
